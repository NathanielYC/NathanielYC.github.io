                <p class="bio">Technology has always been the driving force of my passions since I built my first PC around age 13. 
                    Computer mechanics and electronics have enriched my life with amusement and knowledge for as long as I can remember. 
                    I took classes throughout my college journey to expand upon my knowledge, leading me to my standpoint today. I see 
                    myself working in the videogame industry, a field where I am able to combine my love of technology, innovation, and 
                    artistic creativity into one.<br><br>My educational endeavors have a wide range, including music production, musical performance, 
                    computer mechanics, computer coding, 3D rendering, video game animation, and gaming principles. I plan to utilize these experiences 
                    to create games with solid mechanics, beautiful storylines, and meticulous environments.</p>
